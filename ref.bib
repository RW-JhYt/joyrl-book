  abstract = {The problems of heuristic programming---of making computers solve
	really difficult problems---are divided into five main areas: Search,
	Pattern-Recognition, Learning, Planning, and Induction. Wherever
	appropriate, the discussion is supported by extensive citation of
	the literature and by descriptions of a few of the most successful
	heuristic (problem-solving) programs constructed to date.
	
	The adjective "heuristic," as used here and widely in the literature,
	means related to improving problem-solving performance; as a noun
	it is also used in regard to any method or trick used to improve
	the efficiency of a problem-solving system. A "heuristic program,"
	to be considered successful, must work well on a variety of problems,
	and may often be excused if it fails on some. We often find it worthwhile
	to introduce a heuristic method, which happens to cause occasional
	failures, if there is an over-all improvement in performance. But
	imperfect methods are not necessarily heuristic, nor vice versa.
	Hence "heuristic" should not be regarded as opposite to "foolproof";
	this has caused some confusion in the literature.},
